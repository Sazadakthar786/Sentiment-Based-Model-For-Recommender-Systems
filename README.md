# Sentiment-Based-Model-For-Recommender-Systems
This project implements a **hybrid recommender system** that enhances traditional rating-based recommendations by incorporating **sentiment analysis** from online sources like reviews, blogs, and social media. It is designed to address two major challenges in recommender systems:

* **Cold-Start Problem**: When new users or items lack sufficient interaction history.
* **Data Sparsity**: When there are too few ratings to generate reliable recommendations.

By using **sentiment scores** extracted through natural language processing techniques, this system supplements missing or sparse user ratings, leading to improved **recommendation accuracy** and **personalization**.


### 🔍 Key Features

* 📊 Sentiment analysis from user-generated text
* 🎯 Enhanced prediction for items with few or no ratings
* 🧠 Integration of sentiment data with collaborative filtering
* 📈 Better handling of cold-start and sparse data scenarios


### 🧪 Technologies Used

* Python
* NLP Libraries (e.g., NLTK, TextBlob, or Vader)
* Machine Learning (e.g., Scikit-learn, Surprise)
* Recommender algorithms (Collaborative Filtering, Hybrid Models)


### 🚀 Potential Applications

* E-commerce product suggestions
* Movie or content recommendations
* News article personalization
* Social media-based recommendations
